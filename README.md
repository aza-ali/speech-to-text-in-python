üöÄ Get Ready to Transcribe! - Step-by-Step Setup
Follow these steps to get the script ready to use.

‚úÖ Step 1: Prerequisites - What You Need Before Starting
1. Python Installation: üêç Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. Download from python.org if needed.
2. FFmpeg Installation: üé¨ Important! ffmpeg is required and must be installed and added to your system's PATH. See the next section for detailed FFmpeg installation steps.
üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Installation - Installing Software
üì¶ Step 2.1: Install Python Packages: Open your system's terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

Step 2.2: Run the Package Installation Command: Copy and paste the following command into your terminal and press Enter:

```bash
pip install openai-whisper ffmpeg-python torchaudio
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Run this command directly in your terminal, not within a Python script.

üé¨ Step 2.3: Download FFmpeg (Windows Users):

FFmpeg is crucial for the script to process audio.

a. Go to FFmpeg Downloads: Visit the official FFmpeg Download Page.
b. Find Windows Builds: Look for the "Windows" section and locate builds from gyan.dev or another trusted source.
c. Download Static Build: Download the Static ZIP file specifically for Windows.
d. Extract FFmpeg: Once downloaded, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., C:\ffmpeg).
Step 2.4: Add FFmpeg to System PATH (Windows Users): This step makes FFmpeg accessible to your system.

a. Open System Properties: Press Win + R key, type sysdm.cpl, and press Enter.
b. Go to Environment Variables: In the System Properties window, click the "Advanced" tab, then click "Environment Variables...".
c. Edit Path Variable: In the "System variables" section, scroll down, find, and select the Path variable, then click "Edit...".
d. Add New Path: In the "Edit Environment Variable" window, click "New" and enter the path to the bin folder inside your extracted FFmpeg directory (e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin).
e. Save Changes: Click "OK" on all open windows to save the changes.
Step 2.5: Verify FFmpeg Installation:  Confirm FFmpeg is correctly installed and in your PATH.

a. Open a New Terminal: Close your current terminal and open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell.
b. Run ffmpeg -version: Type ffmpeg -version and press Enter.
c. Check Output: If FFmpeg is correctly installed, you will see version information for FFmpeg. If you get an error, re-check steps 2.3 and 2.4.
üöÄ Step 3: Usage - Transcribing Audio
üíæ Step 3.1: Save the Script: Copy the Python code (provided separately) and save it as a file named speech_to_text.py. Choose a location on your computer where you can easily access it via the terminal.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Step 3.2: Run the Script: Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved speech_to_text.py using the cd command (change directory), and then execute the script by typing:

```bash
python speech_to_text.py
```

üé§ Step 3.3: Enter Audio File Path: When the script runs, it will prompt you with the message: "Enter the path to your audio file:".  Carefully type or paste the full path to your audio file (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Music\my_audio.wav or /Users/yourname/Documents/recording.mp3) and press Enter.

üéâ Step 3.4: Transcription and File Output:

The script will start transcribing your audio file. You will see "Loading Whisper model..." and "Transcribing audio..." messages in the terminal.
Once transcription is complete, the transcribed text will be displayed in your terminal window.
A new text file containing the transcription will be automatically created in the same folder as your original audio file. The text file will have the same name as your audio file but with a .txt extension (e.g., if your audio file was audio.wav, the transcript will be in audio.txt).
The script will print a message in the terminal indicating the location of the saved transcript file.
‚ú® Step 4: Example - A Quick Transcription Test
Let's say you want to transcribe an audio file named voice_note.wav located in your Downloads folder.

Place voice_note.wav in your Downloads folder.
Run the speech_to_text.py script as described in "Step 3: Usage".
When prompted, enter the following path (adjust if your username is different): C:\Users\rtx11\Downloads\voice_note.wav (or the correct path for your system).
After the script finishes, check your Downloads folder. You will find a new file named voice_note.txt containing the transcription.
‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Model Options - Choosing Speed and Accuracy
You can customize the Whisper model used for transcription to balance speed and accuracy:

"tiny": Fastest transcription, smallest model, lowest accuracy. Suitable for quick tests or low-resource environments.
"base": Good balance of transcription speed and accuracy. This is the default model used by the script.
"small": Higher accuracy than "base", but transcription will be slower.
"medium": Even higher accuracy than "small", with a further decrease in transcription speed.
"large": Highest accuracy, slowest transcription speed, and requires more computational resources (GPU recommended for optimal performance).
To change the default model, you need to edit the speech_to_text.py Python code directly.

Step 5.1: Open speech_to_text.py in a text editor.

Step 5.2: Find the transcribe_with_whisper function definition.

Step 5.3: Locate the model_name="base" line:

```python
def transcribe_with_whisper(audio_file_path, model_name="base"): #  &lt;-  Find this line
# ... rest of the code ...
```

Step 5.4: Change the model_name value:  Replace "base" with your desired model name (e.g., "small", "medium", "large", or "tiny"). For example, to use the "small" model, change it to model_name="small".

Step 5.5: Save the speech_to_text.py file.

üêõ Step 6: Troubleshooting - Common Problems and Solutions
Having trouble running the script? Check these common issues:

‚ùå 6.1: ffmpeg Not Found or "Not Working" Errors:

a. Re-check FFmpeg Installation: Carefully go through "Step 2.3 & 2.4: Download & Install FFmpeg" again.
b. Restart Terminal: Ensure you closed and reopened your terminal after modifying the PATH environment variable for FFmpeg.
c. Test ffmpeg -version: Run ffmpeg -version in your terminal. If it doesn't show version information, the PATH setup is likely incorrect.
‚ùå 6.2: "FileNotFoundError" or Path Errors:

a. Verify Audio Path: Double-check that you typed or pasted the correct audio file path when running the script. Pay attention to spelling, capitalization, and file extensions.
b. Confirm File Exists: Make absolutely sure that the audio file you specified actually exists at the exact location you provided.
c. Use Absolute Paths: For reliability, use the full, absolute path to your audio file.
‚ùå 6.3: "Error loading Whisper model" or Model Loading Issues:

a. Internet Connection: The first time you use a Whisper model, the script needs an internet connection to download the model data. Ensure you are connected to the internet.
b. Disk Space: Larger Whisper models require significant disk space (several GBs). Ensure you have sufficient free disk space on your computer.
c. Permissions Issues (Less Common): In rare cases, file permission problems might prevent the model from being downloaded or loaded.
ü§î 6.4: Transcription Accuracy is Not Ideal:

a. Audio Quality Matters Most: The quality of your audio recording is the biggest factor affecting transcription accuracy. Noisy audio, background sounds, or unclear speech will reduce accuracy. Try to use clean audio recordings.
b. Try a Larger Model: For challenging audio, experiment with using a larger Whisper model like "small", "medium", or "large". Remember that larger models are slower and require more resources.
c. Language Support: Whisper is trained primarily on English data. While it supports transcription in multiple languages, accuracy may vary for different languages.
d. Technical Vocabulary: Highly specialized or technical vocabulary can be more difficult for Whisper to transcribe accurately.
